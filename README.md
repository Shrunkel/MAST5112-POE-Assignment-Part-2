Project Overview

The app was designed and created for a talented chef named Christoffel, he is a private chef who is known for designing unique dining experiences. Considering he has a very spontaneous work style, his dishes changes from day to day, never staying the same. The app is created as a tool to capture his creativity, also allowing his audience to view his work whenever he updates his catalogue. The app also allows him to save the dishes he made, making it his own personal notebook.

The app was build using react native with typescript through expo, allowing it to run smoothly on both mobile operating systems, android and IOS. The focus was to make the app functional, visually appealing and also flexible to update quickly allowing Christoffel to add or delete new meals and preparing a menu for his audience to view in an easy and professional way.
